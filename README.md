# Brainstorm
Get a random word to start brainstorming ideas. 
We have a button that you can click to get a random word.

`this is for code?`
`go run main.go`

## Why this stack? 
Dunno. Just felt like creating something without using any frameworks, avoiding any unnecessary headaches.
Started off with using Python but didn't feel like using Flask.
So went with Go instead. 

## Todo
[x] Click button for word
[ ] Scrape for word definition
[ ] Memo feature
[ ] DB to store memos
